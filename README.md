# xacc_qaoa_benchmarks
Benchmarks for multiple QAOA problems using the XACC platform for multiple quantum simulator backends. This project is an extension of the program from the [benchmark_qaoa_IBM](https://github.com/koenmesman/benchmark_qaoa_IBM) repository, translated to the XACC platform. 

# Requirements
- Make sure you have installed the latest version of the XACC plaform. See their [documentation](https://xacc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for installation guide.
- In order to use the IonQ or IBM simulator backends, the XACC requires their respective config files. Creating of these config files is elaborated on the XACC [extentions documentation](https://xacc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions.html)

# Installation
Simply clone this repo and run the main.py script using python3. Different benchmark setups can be executed by configuring parameters in the main.py file.
